# Project Name: Severity Prediction for US Car Accidents

This project has demonstrated the application of Big Data technologies to a real-world problem. Using the Hadoop ecosystem with Hive, we applied large-scale exploratory data analysis to millions of accident records. Therefore, using Apache Spark, we developed a machine learning model capable of predicting crash severity of car accidents in US. The insights gained from this analysis can directly contribute to strategies for enhancing road safety, optimizing emergency response, and guiding infrastructure planning, showing the big value that Big Data Analytics brings to the transportation sector.
